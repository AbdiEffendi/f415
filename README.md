Zurb's Foundation 4.1.5 turned into a WordPress theme. It's a starter theme; all I've done, is got rid of the pain of having to set up foundation to work nice with WordPress.

## Usage

Put this into your themes folder under whatever name you like. You might need to modify the `config.rb` file. Type `grunt` in the directory on the command line and you should be good to go provided you meet the prerequisites.

## Updates

* Included a `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js` for automatic css generation from sass and javascript minification.

## Prerequisites
* `ruby` installed
* `node` installed
* `zurb-foundation 4.1.5` installed
* `grunt-cli` installed
